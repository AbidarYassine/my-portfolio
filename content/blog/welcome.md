# Welcome 👋

Hi, I’m ABIDAR Yassine — a Software Engineer specialized in the Java ecosystem and distributed systems.

I built this site to document what I learn, what I build, and what I discover along the way. Writing helps me clarify my thinking, and sharing it keeps me growing.

## What you can expect

Most articles here focus on:

- Java & Spring Boot
- Clean architecture and system design
- AI integrations in backend systems
- Cloud-native and containerized environments

I prefer writing practical content — less theory, more real-world examples from actual projects.
